      <p class="block-text">No one really knows what it is like to be a chimp or a robot, but we humans do have some ideas about what other minds are like. This survey asks for you to think about and compare different kinds of minds.</p>

      <p class="block-text"><b>First, you'll meet the characters</b> - a chimp, a robot, a baby, a dog, and other characters who may have minds.</p>

      <p class="block-text"><b>Then, you'll complete a survey about a mental ability</b> - such as the ability to feel joy, to think, or to feel pain. Your job is to judge pairs of characters to say if one has more of the ability.</p>

      <p class="block-text">The study should take about <b>10-15 minutes</b> to complete. Please complete the study in one sitting, without interruption. At the end, you'll learn how you ranked all the characters.</p>
